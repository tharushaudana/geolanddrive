## Background

I developed this tool during Sri Lanka's agriculture land measuring project named "GeoGoviya" where my mother is an officer. We faced challenges in managing and drawing lands on the map using Google Earth Pro, which was not user-friendly for all officers. This simple solution aims to address those challenges.

I hope this tool will be helpful and valuable for you.
